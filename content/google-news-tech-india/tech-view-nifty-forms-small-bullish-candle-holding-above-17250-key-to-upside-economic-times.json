  "description": "\"Nifty is struggling to show a conviction close above 17,350, and this could be the level to watch for. A break above 17,350 will mean a rally to 17,600-17,650. On the lower side, support is at 17,250, a break below this will mean a drop to 17,050-17,100. Brace for extreme volatility in coming days,\" Shah said.",
