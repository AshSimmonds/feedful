While the bill’s text wasn’t immediately released, a summary indicates it’s similar to a proposal that <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/7/2/21311464/earn-it-act-section-230-child-abuse-imagery-facebook-youtube-lindsey-graham\">passed the Senate Judiciary Committee</a> last year. That bill limited the typically broad protections that Section 230 grants “interactive computer services” against being sued over user-generated content, adding special conditions for material that runs afoul of CSAM laws.</p><p id=\"Qvrt1a\">The original EARN IT Act’s sponsors touted endorsements from the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children and other groups, and it took aim at <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/11/09/us/internet-child-sex-abuse.html\">a surge of online child sexual abuse content</a>. But the bill was <a href=\"https://www.aclu.org/news/free-speech/the-earn-it-act-is-a-disaster-for-online-speech-and-privacy-especially-for-the-lgbtq-and-sex-worker-communities/\">strongly condemned</a> by the American Civil Liberties Union and many advocates for online civil liberties, sex workers, and LGBT rights — who argued that it would encourage companies to abandon strong encryption and privacy protections for users. Some of these groups, including Fight For the Future, have <a href=\"https://www.fightforthefuture.org/news/2022-02-01-lawmakers-need-to-shelve-the-earn-it-act-before-they-get-someone-killed/\">issued statements</a> against the revived bill as well. The bill is <a href=\"https://www.judiciary.senate.gov/meetings/01/27/2022/executive-business-meeting\">scheduled to be discussed</a> by the Senate Judiciary Committee on Thursday.</p><p id=\"4YvFWN\">The EARN IT Act is <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22309566/section-230-explainer-video-internet-changes-klobuchar-event\">one of several plans</a> to add carveouts or conditions to Section 230, but so far, it’s been one of the only bills to garner significant traction, albeit not enough to earn a vote on the Senate floor. If passed, it would join the 2018 FOSTA-SESTA carveout, which stripped protections for content related to sex work — and has been widely blamed for a crackdown on sex workers online, while <a href=\"https://newrepublic.com/article/162823/sex-trafficking-sex-work-sesta-fosta\">reports have cast doubt</a> on its value as an anti-trafficking law. </p><hr class=\"p-entry-hr\" id=\"igpttB\"><h2 id=\"p5Nwyz\"> Related: </h2><div id=\"yOkxMs\"><div data-analytics-viewport=\"video\" data-analytics-action=\"volume:view:article:middle\" data-analytics-label=\"Taming the internet’s most important law|100857\" data-volume-uuid=\"8c8bbcc5f\" data-volume-id=\"100857\" data-analytics-placement=\"article:middle\" data-volume-placement=\"article\" data-volume-autoplay=\"false\" id=\"volume-placement-198\" class=\"volume-video\"></div></div>",
