After closing at $323 Wednesday, they dropped as low as $238.90 before recovering slightly.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\" \" data-mask-text=\"false\" src=\"https://cdn.vox-cdn.com/thumbor/f2RzmoanfL1gWdXZKUh2T_hYQy8=/400x0/filters:no_upscale()/cdn.vox-cdn.com/uploads/chorus_asset/file/23215494/google_stock.jpg\">      <cite><em>Image: </em><a class=\"ql-link\" href=\"https://www.google.com/search?q=%24fb\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Google</em></a></cite>  </figure><p id=\"4h1huj\"><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2022-02-03/meta-set-for-200-billion-wipeout-among-worst-in-market-history\"><em>Bloomberg</em></a><em> </em>reports that the $200 billion plunge may rank as the biggest single-day drop in market value ever, as Meta struggles with waning relevance among young people and CEO Mark Zuckerberg refocuses its aim toward “metaverse” plans.</p><aside id=\"ycsSkP\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Mark Zuckerberg on why Facebook is rebranding to Meta \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/2/22812275/metaverse-meta-facebook-virtual-world-explainer-video\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"iALsM0\">Meta wasn’t the only company having a rough Thursday; the entire Nasdaq exchange was <a href=\"https://www.google.com/finance/quote/.IXIC:INDEXNASDAQ\">off by nearly 2 percent</a> by midday, and rivals Snap and Twitter were also trading lower. <a href=\"https://www.google.com/finance/quote/SNAP:NYSE\">Snap</a>, which lists on the New York Stock Exchange, was down by more than 20 percent shortly before 11 AM ET, and <a href=\"https://www.google.com/finance/quote/TWTR:NYSE\">Twitter</a>, also on the NYSE, was off by about 6 percent.</p><p id=\"KV4NrL\">Of course, Meta is still worth some $671 billion and reported over $40 billion in profit for 2021, despite the “headwinds” cited frequently on a call with investors to discuss the results. That’s a slightly better position than it was after its <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2012/6/19/3096611/facebook-ipo-startups-valuations-bubble-acquisitions-pop\">2012 “clusterfuck” of an IPO</a> when it took an entire year before the company’s stock rebounded to match the original offering price.</p>",
