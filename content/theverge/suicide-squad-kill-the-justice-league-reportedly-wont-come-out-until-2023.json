The game, which is being made by Rocksteady (the studio behind <em>Batman: Arkham Asylum</em>, <em>City</em>, and <em>Knight</em>), was scheduled to come out sometime in 2022. The <a href=\"https://twitter.com/suicidesquadRS\">game’s Twitter account</a> still lists the release date as 2022 in its bio, but as <em>Bloomberg</em> points out, a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jasonkilar/status/1486344994290126852?s=20&amp;t=gJBqpsqzItZDDP0XNN-kwQ\">tweet from WarnerMedia’s CEO</a> about the company’s 2022 game lineup didn’t include <em>Kill the Justice League</em>.</p><p id=\"ejUiqM\">It’s a slightly odd delay, given that the first gameplay trailer was just released <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/9/22826586/suicide-squad-video-game-gameplay-trailer-the-game-awards\">in December</a> and made the game look like it was getting close to being done. As we’ve seen, though, making a game during a pandemic is difficult, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/15/22676330/battlefield-2042-release-date-delay\">most</a> <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/2/22760118/activision-blizzard-delays-overwatch-2-and-diablo-4-again\">high-profile</a> <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/27/22855536/final-fantasy-xvi-delay-six-months-covid-19-spring-2022-reveal-playstation-5\">games</a> <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22702435/kratos-voice-actor-behind-sony-god-of-war-ragnarok-delay-ps5\">on the</a> <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/25/22602306/horizon-forbidden-west-playstation-delay-2022-february\">horizon</a> have pushed the release dates back at least once.</p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"3AJ72P\"><q>It’s hard to ship games on time, even when there’s not a pandemic</q></aside></div><p id=\"cLWZHM\">Warner Bros., Suicide Squad’s publisher, isn’t going a whole year without a major game release, though. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/19/22340247/gotham-knights-delay-release-date-2022\">Last we heard</a>, its (also DC-themed) <em>Gotham Knights</em> is still set to release at some point in 2022 after it was originally slated to be released in 2021. The company is <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/13/22229085/hogwarts-legacy-delay-2022-release-date\">also set to release</a> the Harry Potter-themed <em>Hogwarts Legacy</em> this year, which also had its own delays.</p><p id=\"dzffGZ\">Warner Bros.
