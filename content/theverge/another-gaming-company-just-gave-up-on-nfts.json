Team17 said the generative NFTs would be “giving fans the chance to own a unique piece of video game memorabilia.” 24 hours later, Team17 <a href=\"https://www.team17.com/team17-to-end-metaworms-nft-project/\">now says</a> it “is today announcing an end to the MetaWorms NFT project. We have listened to our Teamsters, development partners, and our games’ communities, and the concerns they’ve expressed, and have therefore taken the decision to step back from the NFT space.”</p><aside id=\"TuOdUI\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Many game developers hate NFTs, too \",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/20/22893216/gdc-annual-survey-2022-game-developers-nfts\"}]}'></div></aside><div class=\"c-float-right\"><div id=\"FBauWL\"><div data-anthem-component=\"aside:10374749\"></div></div></div><p id=\"vUY3Jt\">How did things change so much, so quickly? As we’ve seen in the response to the announcement of NFTs for<em> </em><a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/15/22834567/stalker-2-nfts-metahuman-dmarket\"><em>S.T.A.L.K.E.R. 2</em></a>, Ubisoft’s <em>Ghost Recon</em> items, and even <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/31/22910633/troy-baker-voiceverse-nft-voice-actor-project-the-last-of-us\">an NFT project for voice acting</a>, the backlash from the gaming community was swift and loud. Perhaps most importantly, it did not stop with tweets from anonymous Twitter accounts or posts on the publisher’s forums — at least three developers behind prominent Team17-published games spoke out in opposition to the plans.</p><div id=\"acBpHP\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"und\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://t.co/t9RwesTp33\">pic.twitter.com/t9RwesTp33</a></p>— Overcooked   (@Overcookedgame) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Overcookedgame/status/1488486066898227205?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 1, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"W14lwr\"><em>Overcooked 2</em> developer Ghost Town Games <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Overcookedgame/status/1488486066898227205\">promised</a> fans that none of its future games will ever engage with NFTs, saying they carry too much environmental and social cost.</p><div id=\"f6Cd40\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"und\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://t.co/004Qi2klpB\">pic.twitter.com/004Qi2klpB</a></p>— Playtonic (@PlaytonicGames) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PlaytonicGames/status/1488529331223728133?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 1, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"oa8bZz\">Playtonic Games has published <em>Yooka-Laylee</em> and <em>Yooka-Laylee and the Impossible Lair </em>through Team17<em> </em>and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PlaytonicGames/status/1488529331223728133\">said in a statement</a> that “[w]e have no interest in utilizing NFTs in any aspect of our business now or in future.

Web3 companies continue to sprout seemingly by the dozens, mostly funded by venture capital, but traction among everyday end users who haven’t chosen to become traders is scarce.</p><div id=\"XqIK2K\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Team17 is today announcing an end to the MetaWorms NFT project. <br><br>We have listened to our Teamsters, development partners, and our games’ communities, and the concerns they’ve expressed, and have therefore taken the decision to step back from the NFT space.</p>— Team17 (@Team17) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Team17/status/1488618187109408780?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">February 1, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div>",
