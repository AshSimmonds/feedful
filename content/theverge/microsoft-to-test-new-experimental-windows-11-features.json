The software maker says it plans to experiment more with features for Windows 11 testers to evaluate that may never ship.</p><p id=\"uiodlN\">“As part of this ongoing evolution, Insiders will see us lean more heavily on the Dev Channel as a place to incubate new ideas, work on long lead items, and control the states of individual features,” <a href=\"https://aka.ms/WIP2022\">explains Amanda Langowski</a>, the lead for the Windows Insider Program. “In some cases, these concepts will never ship, but by experimenting more, we can better refine experiences, and deliver solutions in Windows that truly empower our customers to achieve more.”</p><p id=\"hnt5fb\">We’ve seen some A/B testing like this before, where a subset of Windows Insiders will get access to a feature before Microsoft rolls it out more broadly to testers. In the future though, there could be variations on features that won’t be fully documented by Microsoft. A number of Windows enthusiasts look out for new features every time Microsoft releases a new build, using flags in the operating system to switch hidden features on and see what Microsoft is experimenting with.</p>  <figure class=\"e-image\">        <img alt=\"A user types on the Surface Pro 8 from behind.

That could mean that new features even show up in the Beta Channel first, if they’re closer to shipping.</p><p id=\"8h2tjD\">Microsoft is now planning to give Windows 11 testers a window in which they can switch from the Dev Channel to the Beta Channel, to avoid the more experimental features that are on the way. That will likely coincide with the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/26/22902477/microsoft-windows-11-update-android-apps-preview-taskbar-notepad-media-player\">February release of features</a>, including Android app support, taskbar changes, and the redesigned Notepad and Media Player apps.</p>",
