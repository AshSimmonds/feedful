The P-Series Quantum supports many of the sought-after specs that a PS5 or Xbox Series X owner should look for, including HDMI 2.1, HDR, and a variable refresh rate with 120Hz at 1080p and 60Hz at 4K. When it comes to streaming TV shows and movies, there’s built-in Chromecast and Apple AirPlay 2 compatibility. These TVs come in 65 inches, 75 inches, and a massive 85 inches. Right now, you can get the <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B095XMJM32?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">65-inch P65Q9-J model for just $899</a> on Amazon, knocking $300 off. The <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B095XLZY1K?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">75-inch P75Q9-J01 is also on sale for $1,599</a> — a much higher price, yes, but a slightly bigger savings of $400.</p><aside id=\"CISthj\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"Making sense of new TV features in 2022\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/22884014/tv-features-hardware-screens-hdmi-hdr-vrr-oled-mini-led\"},{\"title\":\"The Verge’s 2022 Valentine’s Day gift guide\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/22890136/valentines-day-2022-gift-ideas-couples-boyfriend-girlfriend-partner-friend\"}]}'></div></aside><div id=\"y8LOKg\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11008733\"></div></div><p id=\"JZoQ9y\">Switching gears over to audio, there are some noteworthy deals on headphones and earbuds. Starting off, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/New-Apple-AirPods-Max-Silver/dp/B08PZJN7BD?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">all colors of the Apple AirPods Max noise-canceling headphones are $449.99</a> (about $100 off) on Amazon. We’ve mentioned the AirPods Max plenty of times in our deal roundups before, and there’s good reason — they’re an excellent pair of headphones if you live in Apple’s ecosystem, and they go on sale often. </p><p id=\"e50jRl\">The frequency of discounts on these cans urges me to suggest never to pay full price. Though there is one caveat to that: if you desire a certain color. It’s common to see only one or two AirPods Max colors go on sale at a time, and sometimes, it’s the more vibrant ones that not everyone wants. So it’s nice to see a great price on these spatial audio-equipped Bluetooth headphones with a full choice of hue. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22177494/apple-airpods-max-headphones-review-price-features\"><strong>Read our review</strong></a>.</p><div id=\"E8nP9d\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10361602\"></div></div><p id=\"NBuumt\">Another popular audio device that’s frequently been on sale in the past is the Samsung Galaxy Buds Pro. These are Samsung’s flagship true-wireless earbuds, and we haven’t seen a deal this good on them since we reached 2022. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B099X4HMV4?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://goto.target.com/c/482924/81938/2092?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.target.com%2Fp%2Fsamsung-galaxy-buds-pro-true-wireless-bluetooth-earbuds%2F-%2FA-82244531%3Fpreselect%3D82026965%23lnk%3Dsametab&amp;subid1=vergedailydeals020222\">Target</a>, and <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgx2eGClnOq\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a> each have all colors of Buds Pro available for $149.99 ($50 off). That’s about $25 away from their all-time low price but still an excellent value for a top-tier earbud. </p><p id=\"sQ81eN\">If you use Samsung phones, these are your AirPods Pro equivalent, with easy connectivity, active noise cancellation, IPX7-rated water resistance, and a wireless charging case. They are, of course, compatible with any Bluetooth-equipped device, so even if you don’t live and breathe Samsung, these are a solid pair to consider. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/1/15/22231848/samsung-galaxy-buds-pro-review\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Read our review</strong></a>.</p><aside id=\"Jv6WZY\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"The best deals on true wireless earbuds right now\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/22307388/wireless-earbuds-deals-airpods-galaxy-buds-powerbeats\"}]}'></div></aside><div id=\"KIFt2U\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10401237\"></div></div><p id=\"WOko50\">Now for a new kid on the block deal: the Anker Soundcore Liberty 3 Pro are a pair of true wireless earbuds we have yet to review but offer a lot on paper. Anker’s Soundcore line is known for being a great value proposition, with aggressive pricing on mid-range performing gear. The Liberty 3 Pro <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/7/22713461/anker-liberty-3-pro-earbuds-announced-price-specs-ldac\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">came out in late-2021</a> with a higher price that put them in closer competition with flagship earbuds from Apple, Samsung, and others — albeit still undercutting them a bit. These earbuds feature active noise cancellation and LDAC audio support, which is pretty rare outside of much more expensive sets. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B09CG3B9SW?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon has the Liberty 3 Pro for $129.99</a> ($40 off), making them a very low-cost option for such high-spec features.</p><div id=\"P6l62W\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11008759\"></div></div><h2 id=\"k0yURA\">More deals you don’t want to miss:</h2><ul><li id=\"2K8AeA\"><a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgx2sMndIcD\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy has a 16TB Western Digital USB 3.0 external drive for $279.99</a> ($194 off) if you’re in need of a massive amount of storage. </li><li id=\"gSGHZI\"><a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgx2vrN48A6\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">SanDisk’s Ultra 1TB PCIe Gen 3 NVMe SSD is just $84.99</a> ($145 off) at Best Buy.
