Today, the Microsoft Surface Laptop 4 is available at a new all-time low. <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08YWZTCMD?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon is currently selling the laptop</a> with an AMD Ryzen 7 CPU, ‎8GB of RAM, and a 512GB SSD for $1,288.99 instead of $1,499.99. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22392778/microsoft-surface-laptop-4-15-inch-review\">In her review</a>, <em>The Verge’s</em> Monica Chin praised the device for being such a massive improvement over its predecessor, the aptly-titled Surface Laptop 3. She was also impressed by the laptop’s excellent battery life, lightweight build, and tall 3:2 display. While it released in April 2021, it remains a good buy if you’re looking for an efficient Windows machine and don’t mind its distinct lack of ports.</p><p id=\"Jstqce\">While <em>slightly </em>more expensive, Best Buy is also offering a $200 discount, <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgx4RGBwPhD\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">selling the same configuration for $1,299.99</a>.</p><aside id=\"N2TSFl\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"The best laptops you can buy right now\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/21250695/best-laptops\"}]}'></div></aside><div id=\"ZS1JJs\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10882775\"></div></div><p id=\"0d2NSo\">Like many TVs in the run up to Super Bowl Sunday, the 55-inch version of Samsung’s decor-meets-tech Frame TV has returned to its Black Friday price. Regularly $1,497.99, several retailers — including <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buydig.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FSAMQN55LS03AA%2FSamsung-QN55LS03AA-55-Inch-The-Frame-QLED-4K-Smart-TV-2021&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2022%2F2%2F3%2F22914248%2Fsamsung-frame-tv-microsoft-surface-laptop-4-apple-ipad-pro-air-playstation-deal-sale\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">BuyDig</a>, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1620610-REG%2Fsamsung_qn55ls03aafxza_the_frame_ls03a_55.html&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2022%2F2%2F3%2F22914248%2Fsamsung-frame-tv-microsoft-surface-laptop-4-apple-ipad-pro-air-playstation-deal-sale\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">B&amp;H Photo</a>, <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgx4fQUcfnv\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Samsung</a>, and <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgx3Lr82exs\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a> — are selling it for around $998, which is also its lowest price to date. That’s a savings of $500 on a TV that displays artwork when its sensors detect that somebody’s in the room, but can easily turn into a smart 4K TV when needed. In addition to boasting a 120Hz refresh rate, the TV also comes with support for Amazon’s Alexa for voice commands, it has four HDMI ports, and the Tizen smart platform gives you access to most major streaming services without needing a dedicated streaming device.</p><p id=\"gzA6Zb\">Other configurations are on sale, too. The 65-inch, for example, is selling for around $1,498 at <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.buydig.com%2Fshop%2Fproduct%2FSAMQN65LS03AA&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2022%2F2%2F3%2F22914248%2Fsamsung-frame-tv-microsoft-surface-laptop-4-apple-ipad-pro-air-playstation-deal-sale\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">BuyDig</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/SAMSUNG-55-Inch-Class-Frame-Built/dp/B08VW898FS/ref=asc_df_B08VWPBBTF/?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.bhphotovideo.com%2Fc%2Fproduct%2F1620617-REG%2Fsamsung_qn65ls03aafxza_the_frame_ls03a_65.html&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2022%2F2%2F3%2F22914248%2Fsamsung-frame-tv-microsoft-surface-laptop-4-apple-ipad-pro-air-playstation-deal-sale\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">B&amp;H Photo</a>, <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgx37kA5LRG\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a>, and <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgx36rru2ei\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Samsung</a>, which is $2 shy of the all-time low we saw during Black Friday. Best Buy is also taking $90 off of the Facebook Portal TV with your purchase, up to $300 off on select soundbars, and offering new subscribers a month of Philo for $5 with each purchase.</p><aside id=\"igUYxG\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"The best TVs to buy ahead of the Super Bowl\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/22910683/best-tv-super-bowl-2022\"},{\"title\":\"Super Bowl 2022 won’t stream in 4K on NBC\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22878110/super-bowl-lvi-2022-no-4k-streaming\"}]}'></div></aside><div id=\"zMul9q\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10711541\"></div></div><div id=\"uICdp1\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10819823\"></div></div><p id=\"bRQM12\">Shifting away from TVs to iPads, the latest 12.9-inch iPad Pro is available for pick-up at Micro Center in both <a href=\"https://www.microcenter.com/product/636903/apple-ipad-pro-129-inch-silver-(mid-2021\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">silver</a> and <a href=\"https://www.microcenter.com/product/636902/apple-ipad-pro-129-inch-space-gray-(mid-2021)\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">space gray</a> for $899.99, a new all-time low. That’s a $200 discount off the original price, and even lower than the price we saw on the 128GB, Wi-Fi-ready model on Black Friday. Equipped with the M1 processor, the 2021 iPad Pro is blazing-fast and delivers excellent performance.

The same configuration of the iPad Pro is <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B0932BKSLP?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">$999 at Amazon</a>, a $100 discount that matches its Black Friday price. <a href=\"https://goto.walmart.com/c/482924/565706/9383?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.walmart.com%2Fip%2FApple-12-9-inch-iPad-Pro-2021-Wi-Fi-256GB-Space-Gray%2F774697337&amp;subid1=TheVergeDailyDeals232022\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Walmart is offering the same discount</a>.</p><p id=\"oEVKr1\">If you want something a little cheaper, the 2020 iPad Air, which we currently consider to be the best tablet for most people, is also still on sale for its best price to date.
