Thankfully, if you’re not one for elaborate bouquets and gushy, traditional displays of affection, it’s easy enough to just treat the holiday as an excuse to get cool stuff for the people you care about most. After all, who isn’t a fan of a picnic-ready backpack, a warm pair of slippers, or a clever co-op title?</p><p id=\"hehVKZ\">To gather some gift ideas, we’ve cast a wide net, enlisting <em>The Verge</em>’s staff to submit products they are giving this year or ones that they would love to receive. Our gift guide includes suggestions for people who are active and spontaneous, as well as some ideas for those who are homebodies or prefer a gift that’s a little more low-key. While most can be used by one person at a time, some of them can involve everyone in the relationship, rendering them a great excuse to ditch the screen and spend some quality time together.</p><div id=\"Lj3nI9\"><div data-anthem-component=\"table:10986298\"></div></div>",
