Multiple users <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/sjkat0/pixel_6_pro_magic_eraser_crashes_photos_app/\">across</a> <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/sk71hx/magic_eraser/\">Reddit</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/johnsohrawardi/status/1489481174976442369\">and</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/reaper_IA07/status/1489278039229927425\">Twitter</a> are reporting that attempting to use it causes the Google Photos app to crash, leaving them unable to use a feature that’s been <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WA6TrAwHQug\">heavily marketed</a> in the promotion of Google’s latest flagship smartphone.</p><p id=\"4ofQiL\">The issue is the latest in a series of bugs to have hit the Pixel 6. Back in December, Google was forced to <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/30/22860191/pixel-6-pro-google-december-feature-update-paused\">halt the rollout of an update</a> after owners complained that it was causing network connection problems for their devices. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22881882/android-12-google-pixel-6-pro-bugs-oneplus-oxygenos-12-samsung-one-ui-4-update\">Android 12 has been an unusually rocky update</a> for many devices, but Google’s Pixel lineup seems to have been especially hard hit. This isn’t even the first bug affecting the magic eraser feature, after an earlier update <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/12/22778869/google-pixel-6-pro-magic-eraser-feature-gone-photos-update-fix\">magically erased it from phones</a>.</p><p id=\"iGvww3\"><a href=\"https://www.androidpolice.com/magic-eraser-causing-google-photos-to-crash-on-the-pixel-6-and-pixel-6-pro/\"><em>Android Police</em> reports</a> that the issue appears related to Google Photos version 5.76.0.425427310, and for now there doesn’t seem to be a way to fix the problem. Google’s support accounts have responded to a <a href=\"https://twitter.com/madebygoogle/status/1489280251192565762\">couple</a> of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/googlephotos/status/1489491253297303554\">complaints</a>, and are advising affected users to contact support and follow the troubleshooting steps on this <a href=\"https://support.google.com/googleplay/answer/2668665\">support page</a>. In the meantime, if you depend on access to the magic eraser tool then you might want to disable automatic updates on the Google Photos app.</p>",
