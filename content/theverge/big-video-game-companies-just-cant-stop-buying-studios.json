Take-Two kicked things off with its deal <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/10/22876184/take-two-interactive-zynga-acquisition-deal\">to buy Zynga for $12.7 billion</a>, which at the time may have counted as the biggest deal in the video game industry, but Microsoft significantly one-upped that just a week later with its <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22889258/microsoft-activision-blizzard-xbox-acquisition-call-of-duty-overwatch\">$68.7 billion deal to buy Activision Blizzard</a>. The total value of all three acquisitions, assuming they all go through, is a staggering <em>$85 billion</em>.</p><p id=\"fZj76p\">With Bungie, Sony will house the talent behind the hugely popular <em>Destiny 2</em>, and it seems likely the company will use Bungie’s expertise to help create similarly expansive and long-running live service titles. Sony is renowned for its expensive single-player games like <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/4/12/17223854/god-of-war-review-ps4\"><em>God of War</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21323144/ghost-of-tsushima-review-ps4-game-developer-samurai\"><em>Ghost of Tsushima</em></a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/21286964/the-last-of-us-part-2-review-ps4\"><em>The Last of Us</em></a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22523093/ratchet-clank-rift-apart-review-ps5\"><em>Ratchet &amp; Clank: Rift Apart</em></a>, but it doesn’t have its own take on <em>Fortnite</em> or <em>Destiny</em> that’s updated regularly over the course of many years to keep players coming back.</p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"1HYRhy\"><q>Sony’s Bungie deal is a big one, but it’s only the latest in a recent buying spree</q></aside></div><p id=\"ueydWS\">While PlayStation boss Jim Ryan said in an <a href=\"https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2022-01-31-playstation-bungie-will-considerably-accelerate-our-journey-with-multiplatform-live-service-games\">interview with <em>Gamesindustry.biz</em></a> that the Bungie deal wasn’t a response to the big acquisitions already announced in 2022, it’s hard to look at Sony’s recent purchases as anything but an attempt to keep up with a tidal wave of consolidation in the industry. Just in 2021, Sony acquired <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/22558968/playstation-studios-acquires-nixxes-software-pc-ports\">PC port developer Nixxes Software</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/29/22555358/sony-housemarque-returnal-developer-acquisition-bluepoint\"><em>Returnal</em> developer Housemarque</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/8/22662706/sony-firesprite-the-playroom-developers-playstation-studios\"><em>The Playroom</em> maker Firesprite Studios</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/9/30/22665426/sony-buys-bluepoint-games-remake-remaster-demons-souls-shadow-ico-uncharted\">PlayStation remake / remaster experts Bluepoint Games</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.gameinformer.com/2021/12/10/sony-to-acquire-developer-valkyrie-entertainment\"><em>God of War</em> support studio Valkyrie Entertainment</a>. </p><p id=\"ykkIw9\">Microsoft has <em>also</em> been on <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22890225/microsoft-xbox-activision-blizzard-aqcuisition-game-studios\">a buying spree</a>, acquiring <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/3/9/22319124/microsoft-bethesda-acquisition-complete-finalized\">ZeniMax Media / Bethesda Softworks in 2021</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/6/9/18658920/microsoft-acquires-double-fine-psychonauts-e3-2019\"><em>Psychonauts 2</em> developer Double Fine Productions in 2019</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2018/6/10/17446914/microsoft-studios-the-initiative-undead-labs-playground-games-ninja-theory-compulsion-games-xbox-e3\">announcing a five-studio addition to its roster in 2018</a>. I’d also be remiss if I didn’t mention Microsoft’s very successful purchase of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2014/11/6/7167283/Minecraft-now-officially-belongs-to-microsoft-what-you-should-know\">Minecraft maker <em>Mojang</em> in 2014</a>.</p><p id=\"10sghT\">It’s not just Sony and Microsoft that have opened their wallets. Facebook parent company Meta has shelled out for <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/16/22537795/is-facebook-cornering-the-vr-market\">a whole bunch of VR studios</a> to give its Quest headsets an edge (though Meta’s VR division is reportedly coming under <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/14/22884198/ftc-state-ag-investigating-meta-facebook-vr-oculus-antitrust\">some scrutiny from the government</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/16/22840635/ftc-opens-antitrust-probe-meta-deal-vr-fitness-app-supernatural\">including for</a> its purchase of the maker of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/29/22753403/supernatural-within-studio-facebook-meta-oculus-vr-fitness-experiences-metaverse\">VR fitness app Supernatural</a>). EA has spent billions to acquire <a href=\"https://www.gamesindustry.biz/articles/2021-02-18-ea-completes-codemasters-acquisition-and-hopes-to-revolutionise-racing-games\">Codemasters</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/2/8/22273187/ea-glu-mobile-acquisition-kim-kardashian-hollywood\">Glu Mobile</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/6/23/22547324/ea-golf-clash-playdemic-acquisition-warner-brothers-games-mobile\">Playdemic</a>. And Chinese giant Tencent is behind a lot more of the industry than you might realize: it’s the developer of the mobile hits <em>Call of Duty: Mobile</em>, <em>Honor of Kings</em>, and <em>Pokémon Unite</em>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2015/12/17/10410952/riot-games-league-of-legends-acquired-tencent\">owns <em>League of Legends</em> maker Riot Games</a>, <a href=\"https://www.polygon.com/2013/3/21/4131702/tencents-epic-games-stock-acquisition\">has a 40 percent stake in <em>Fortnite</em> creator Epic Games</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2016/6/21/11986712/tencent-supercell-softbank-majority-stake-acquisition\">bought <em>Clash of Clans</em> studio Supercell from SoftBank</a> in 2016, just to name a few things.</p><div class=\"c-float-right\"><aside id=\"qrMm4x\"><q>Which company is next?</q></aside></div><p id=\"iZGHcT\">The wave of acquisitions, especially the deals for Activision Blizzard and Bungie, also make previously unfathomable ideas that much more possible. Could Sony buy Square Enix to make <em>Final Fantasy</em> a PlayStation-exclusive series? What if Microsoft bought Ubisoft to make <em>Assassin’s Creed</em> <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22890553/microsoft-activision-xbox-game-pass-competition-subscription\">yet another draw for Xbox Game Pass</a>? Would Nintendo buy Sega Sammy to make Sonic a first-party franchise? If you had asked me in December, I would have laughed at all of those ideas, but now, I don’t think I’d bat an eye.   </p><p id=\"yJsvpY\">Sony is also signaling that there could be more acquisitions to come. “We should absolutely expect more,” Ryan told <em>Gamesindustry.biz</em>. “We are by no means done. With PlayStation, we have a long way to go.” Sony’s deal for Bungie isn’t complete yet, but another major studio acquisition seems inevitable at this point — <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/31/22911274/wordle-new-york-times-free-word-game-acquisition\">even free word games aren’t safe</a>.</p><p id=\"YwzQFx\"></p>",
