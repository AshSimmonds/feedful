That said, <em>The New York Times</em>’ announcement leaves plenty of room for the company to decide to put <em>Wordle</em> behind its paywall in the future. </p><div id=\"uavHcx\"><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">An update on Wordle <a href=\"https://t.co/TmHd0AIRLX\">pic.twitter.com/TmHd0AIRLX</a></p>— Josh Wardle (@powerlanguish) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/powerlanguish/status/1488263944309731329?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">January 31, 2022</a></blockquote><script async=\"\" src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></div><p id=\"f08P2Z\">In his announcement of the sale — for a price that <em>The New York Times</em>’ announcement reports is “an undisclosed price in the low seven figures” — Wardle explains that running the hugely popular game has “been a little overwhelming,” especially considering that he’s the only person who actually handles running the entire game. </p><p id=\"seo9Ll\">“We could not be more thrilled to become the new home and proud stewards of this magical game, and are honored to help bring Josh Wardle’s cherished creation to more solvers in the months ahead,” said Jonathan Knight, general manager for The New York Times Games, in the Times’ announcement of the acquisition. When it moves over to The New York Times, <em>Wordle</em> will join a lineup of other popular daily puzzles, including The New York Times Crossword, the Mini crossword, Spelling Bee, Letter Boxed, Tiles, and Vertex. </p><aside id=\"9YG7Mt\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"How to play Wordle\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/22892044/wordle-free-game-online-how-to-puzzle\"}]}'></div></aside><p id=\"mW8336\">As an earlier <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/03/technology/wordle-word-game-creator.html\"><em>New York Times</em> profile details</a>, Wordle was originally created by Wardle as a gift for his partner, Palak Shah, after the two of them got hooked on word games (like the Times’ Spelling Bee and crosswords) during the pandemic. It was publicly released in late 2020, but has since exploded in popularity, thanks in part to the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/tldr/22881995/wordle-emoji-results-auto-generated-tell-a-story\">viral, emoji-based messages</a> that allow players to share how they did on the daily puzzle without spoiling it for others. </p><p id=\"1MKPP5\">While Wardle kept <em>Wordle</em> as an intentionally free, web-based experience, the app was quickly copied by multiple clones that sought to capitalize on the game’s popularity with knockoff iPhone apps. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22879295/wordle-clones-app-store-removal-online-backlash-copycats\">Apple quickly banned those apps</a> from the App Store following <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/11/22878752/wordle-app-store-review-copies-advertisements-in-app-purchase\">reports that put a spotlight on the clones</a>, although <em>Wordle</em>’s skyrocketing success has also helped lift up older, unrelated word games (<a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/16/22886523/wordle-wardle-app-donate-charity-popularity-spike\">like the similarly named Wordle!</a>), too. </p>",
