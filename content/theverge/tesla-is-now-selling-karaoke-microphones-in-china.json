The accessory, which is only available in China for now, was released alongside a Chinese New Year software update that includes a companion karaoke app called Leishi KTV.</p><p id=\"Fuz1Pu\">The TeslaMic was available on the Chinese Tesla online shop for 1,199 CNY ($188.48 USD). We say “was” because it apparently sold out within an hour, and <a href=\"https://shop.tesla.cn/product/teslamic?sku=1780392-00-A\">the listing</a> does not currently load anymore.
