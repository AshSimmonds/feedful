It’ll be marketed under the brand name Spikevax. </p><p id=\"0Pdbn5\">The full approval is based on clinical trial data from nearly 30,000 people, which showed the vaccine was safe and effective protection against COVID-19. There’s also a year of real-world data for this vaccine, which has been administered to tens of millions of people in the US. Along with the other COVID-19 shots available, it’s saved millions of lives through the last year of the COVID-19 pandemic. </p>",
