If it meets the requirement, the NLRB would determine which positions would be included in the bargaining unit, Blado added, before setting a date for an election. </p><p id=\"UMYE2l\">The ALU, which is made up of current and former Amazon workers, is also <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/26/22903584/amazon-jfk8-warehouse-union-election-labor-nlrb\">moving forward with unionization</a> at the company’s JFK8 warehouse on Staten Island after the NLRB determined it had met the showing of interest required to hold an election. The NLRB has scheduled a hearing for February 16th and will then determine the date for the election. </p><p id=\"VonLWA\">The ALU has been trying to organize Amazon workers in New York City for some time; it <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/10/21/22738310/amazon-warehouse-workers-staten-island-union-election-nlrb\">filed with the NLRB</a> in October to hold an election but later withdrew the request because it lacked enough workers’ signatures. In December, the ALU refiled its petition for just the JFK8 workers, which had been the site of <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/3/30/21199942/amazon-warehouse-coronavirus-covid-new-york-protest-walkout\">several worker walkouts</a> throughout the pandemic.</p><p id=\"9fwRHi\">It’s a busy month for Amazon workers seeking to unionize; on Friday, workers at its Bessemer, Alabama warehouse will get a second chance to vote whether to join the Retail, Wholesale and Department Store Union (RWDSU). A first <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/9/22374540/amazon-union-vote-outcome-bessemer-alabama-rwdsu-bhm1\">vote last April</a> went against the union, but the NLRB determined <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/21/22445940/amazon-union-nlrb-hearing-mailbox-bessemer\">Amazon had interfered</a> with the voting and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/11/29/22565851/amazon-bessemer-union-vote-nlrb-appeal-overturned-second-election\">ordered the second election</a>.</p><p id=\"8pp4gK\"><em><strong>Update February 3rd 2:55PM ET:</strong></em><em> Updates with confirmation from the NLRB that it has received the petition.</em></p><p id=\"TO1kTV\"></p><p id=\"NvL0dM\"></p><p id=\"K90hG4\"></p>",
