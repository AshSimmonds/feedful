And while today may be <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_lil_i_am/status/1488540794784989184\">unapologetically February</a>, we can always brighten things up a bit with some deals.</p><p id=\"NO7XY6\">If you’re in need of a new streaming device as we approach the Super Bowl or even this weekend’s NFL Pro Bowl, Roku’s Streambar Pro is a nice all-in-one solution as a soundbar and 4K-capable streaming device — and it’s currently on sale. You can pick one up for $149.99 ($30 off) at <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Roku-Streambar-Streaming-Cinematic-Headphone/dp/B08ZJ384PP?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a> and <a href=\"https://shop-links.co/cgyQS5naWXy\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Best Buy</a>. The Streambar Pro runs Roku’s popular and straightforward user interface, and you can even expand it later by adding wireless speakers and a subwoofer to go full-on surround sound.</p><p id=\"87ntE0\">If you don’t need such a large soundbar or expansive system to grow into, the smaller Roku Streambar is less than half the size with the same 4K streaming apps. <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F154197892193%3Famdata%3Denc%253AAQAGAAAAkC07is003ZxL1ot05bB9l9sEU6VYV0aS1thseSDLi8CBxh9%252BkDwSyDpEfjsUXC2wcdomt2ekW60ucAyLAXnBALpLKJHSlzUzHNmip81AItONdNPcALbANlzRKK2YPFmHivBapKp1ucq5nJt%252BSA3nolNNCbPQBOHs%252B0puBnMA8eNCzqdOIe8ijHYIqrUQ4%252FT1CA%253D%253D%26mkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26customid%3DVergeDeals020422%26toolid%3D10001%26mkevt%3D1&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F2%2F4%2F22915989%2Froku-streambar-pro-soundbar-apple-watch-samsung-galaxy-watch-4-xbox-deal-sale\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">It’s currently $89.23 on eBay with code <strong>VDAY15OFF</strong></a>, knocking about $41 off its usual full price of $129.99.

We’re always on the lookout for when there’s a chance to order the PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X, but right now, there’s an opportunity to buy the smaller Xbox Series S with a nice discount. <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2F294791849968%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26customid%3DVergeDeals020422%26toolid%3D10001%26mkevt%3D1&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2F2022%2F2%2F4%2F22915989%2Froku-streambar-pro-soundbar-apple-watch-samsung-galaxy-watch-4-xbox-deal-sale\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">Antonline is selling the Xbox Series S Fortnite and Rocket League Bundle for $279.99 on its eBay store</a>. This includes some free in-game content for both free-to-play titles, and the whole package is $20 lower than its usual price of $299.99.</p><p id=\"KPEqm9\">The Xbox Series S doesn’t have the 4K capabilities of its bigger Series X sibling, but it can play all the latest titles at a respectable QHD resolution — and it’s so small and adorable to boot. Just be aware that its built-in 512GB of SSD storage yields about 364GB of usable space, which some games easily soak up nearly a third of with one install.
