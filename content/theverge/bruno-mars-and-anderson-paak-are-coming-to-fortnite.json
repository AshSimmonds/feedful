The duo, who perform together under the moniker Silk Sonic, will be available in the <em>Fortnite</em> item shop starting on February 10th. (Though players will have a chance to get them early via an in-game tournament on February 7th.)</p><p id=\"1QyWlG\">While the game is known for mashing up pop culture worlds from Marvel, Star Wars, and elsewhere, real-world celebrities are also some of the most popular characters. That includes athletes like <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/12/22570612/lebron-james-fortnite-skin-release-date\">LeBron James</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/25/22399880/fortnite-neymar-skin\">Neymar</a>, streamers like <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/7/19/22583750/fortnite-world-cup-champion-bugha-skin-release-date\">Bugha</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/1/15/21065235/ninja-fortnite-skin-announced-stream-tyler-blevins-available-date\">Ninja</a>, and other musicians such as <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/2/18208223/fortnite-epic-games-marshmello-concert-exciting-bizarre-future-music\">Marshmello</a> and <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/8/9/22616664/ariana-grande-fortnite-rift-tour-worldbuilding-storytelling\">Ariana Grande</a>. This also isn’t the first time the members of Silk Sonic have been featured in the game; <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/4/2/22363804/fortnite-bruno-mars-emote\">Mars has his own <em>Fortnite</em> emote</a>, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2020/9/15/21437843/fortnite-anderson-paak-spotlight-concert-date\">while .Paak was part of a virtual concert series in 2020</a>. Outside of the new combatants and their associated gear, <em>Fortnite</em> is also getting a new in-game radio station called Icon Radio, which, naturally, will feature tunes from the musical duo.</p><p id=\"o4f4lo\">It’s a particularly busy time for Epic’s battle royale. Since the game kicked off <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2021/12/5/22817392/fortnite-chapter-3-season-1-spider-man-new-island\">its latest chapter last year</a>, there have been <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/18/22888226/fortnite-update-tilted-towers-monsters-kaws\">new additions like goofy dinosaurs and classic locations</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.epicgames.com/fortnite/en-US/news/unlock-the-foundation-leader-of-the-seven-in-the-fortnite-chapter-3-season-1-battle-pass\">earlier today</a>, a character played by Dwayne Johnson was unlocked for those who purchased this season’s battle pass. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/19/22891305/fortnite-kaws-art-gallery\"><em>Fortnite</em> was even the host of a recent virtual art exhibition</a>.</p>",
