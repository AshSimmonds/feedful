Compared to some other projects where developers upscale or otherwise modernize the visuals for a new generation or platform of hardware, this team pored over every image asset, using funds donated by fans of the project to improve upon Capcom’s PC port of the game.</p><p id=\"fVzgrq\">In some cases where old textures just didn’t look all that good at a higher resolution, the team remade many of them from scratch using photos or AI, while striving to remain faithful to the aesthetic of the original game. When I interviewed Albert Marin in early 2021, the team had amassed over 4,500 Photoshop files and had put in over 9,000 hours of work on the project. </p><p id=\"yfWCgg\">Personally, I’m surprised (but glad) that the team didn’t receive a cease and desist order from Capcom — especially closer to when the <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22726158/resident-evil-4-vr-capcom-oculus-quest-2-review\">VR version released on the Quest 2</a>. In a show of good faith, the company even pinned a forum post about <a href=\"https://steamcommunity.com/app/254700/discussions/\">the fan-made patch on <em>Resident Evil 4</em>’s Discussion page on Steam</a>.
