While the XM3 may show their age at this point, <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2019/7/5/20682334/sony-wf-1000xm3-wireless-earbuds-hands-on-preview-features\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">in his 2019 review</a>, Chris Welch gave these earbuds excellent marks for their sound quality and great battery life. </p><div id=\"cjjASd\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:10848037\"></div></div><p id=\"HOVEJB\">The highly-anticipated <em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</em> was released just a few days ago, but is <a href=\"https://go.redirectingat.com?id=66960X1514734&amp;xs=1&amp;url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.ebay.com%2Fitm%2FPokemon-Legends-Arceus-Nintendo-Switch-%2F284624076089%3Fmkcid%3D1%26mkrid%3D711-53200-19255-0%26siteid%3D0%26campid%3D5338794975%26customid%3DVergeDealsRoundup013122%26toolid%3D10001%26mkevt%3D1&amp;referrer=theverge.com&amp;sref=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.theverge.com%2Fgood-deals%2F2022%2F1%2F31%2F22909626%2Fipad-air-acer-chromebook-pokemon-legends-sony-earbuds-noise-cancelling-corsair-headset-deal-sale\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">currently available for $49.99 at eBay</a>, taking $10 off the regular price. Serving as something of a prequel to other Pok<em>é</em>mon titles, this installment takes a slightly different approach from previous games in the series. While the overarching goal will always be to “catch them all,” <em>Arceus </em>leans heavily into established RPG mechanics like quests and side missions while adding some wrinkles to the familiar gameplay loop by adding a crafting system and eliminating gym leader battles. <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22898939/pokemon-legends-arceus-review-nintendo-switch\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">In our review</a> by <em>Verge</em> staffer Andrew Webster, he mentioned that this title represents “the biggest overhaul to the <em>Pokémon</em> formula since the series debuted.”  </p><div id=\"JRUYOm\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11004970\"></div></div><p id=\"npWNuS\">The Corsair Virtuoso RGB wireless headset is currently available in its white and gold colorway at Amazon for its lowest price ever.

While it's unfortunate that this discount doesn’t extend to its other colorways, this is the best price we’ve seen for this headset. The Virtuoso RGB is built with a sturdy aluminum frame and a plush leatherette headband with customizable RGB logos on both earcups. The headset features USB wireless connectivity and is compatible with Sony consoles as well as PC. However, you’ll have to rely on its 3.5mm wired connection if you’re planning to use this headset with your Nintendo Switch, Xbox, or any compatible mobile device.</p><div id=\"mRgr0T\"><div data-anthem-component=\"productcard:11004962\"></div></div><aside id=\"DQkTLx\"><div data-anthem-component=\"readmore\" data-anthem-component-data='{\"stories\":[{\"title\":\"The best gaming headset deals you can get right now\",\"url\":\"https://www.theverge.com/good-deals/22876408/best-gaming-headset-deals-sales\"}]}'></div></aside><h2 id=\"1dFaur\">Some other great deals to check out</h2><ul><li id=\"rhfbix\">Whether you need to free up some extra space for <em>Pokémon Legends: Arceus</em> or you’re just preparing for the impending release of the Steam Deck, this microSD card deal at Amazon is <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/SanDisk-400GB-microSDXC-Memory-Adapter/dp/B08GYG5SVQ?tag=theverge02-20\" rel=\"sponsored nofollow noopener\" target=\"_blank\">offering a 400GB Samsung model for just $39.99</a> instead of its typical $69.99.</li><li id=\"oQXCJJ\">This 1TB T7 external SSD from Samsung offers hardware encryption that can be secured with your fingerprint.
