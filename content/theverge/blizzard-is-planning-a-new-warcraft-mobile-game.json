For now, all we know is that it’s <em>Warcraft</em>, and it’ll be mobile. </p><p id=\"A6Tv82\">The news coincides neatly with the earnings report also revealing consumers spent over a billion dollars on <em>Call of Duty Mobile </em>in 2021 and <em>Candy Crush</em>’s continued dominance of the app store revenue leaderboards. </p><p id=\"Qxy9Uy\">It’s interesting that Activision Blizzard is planning this Warcraft mobile title for this year. <em>Diablo Immortal</em> — a <em>Diablo</em> mobile game — has been in development since its announcement in 2018 and is also scheduled for a 2022 release. The seemingly short distance between announcement and theoretical release might be a lesson learned from <em>Overwatch 2</em>’s premature reveal. It’s also possible this mobile game isn’t as expansive as <em>Diablo Immortal</em> and therefore doesn’t require the same amount of development time. Regardless, between this sudden news of a <em>Warcraft </em>mobile game and the announcement of a wholly new <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/2022/1/25/22901146/activision-blizzard-new-survival-game-announcement\">Blizzard-developed survival game</a>, the company is putting its best foot forward to its (pending) Microsoft overlords.</p><p id=\"pb1j1k\"></p><p id=\"g3Vmd6\"></p><p id=\"jPtHya\"></p><p id=\"yNPLEn\"></p>",
