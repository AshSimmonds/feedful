We’ve finally gotten to try out the flagship in this line, the 14-core Core i9-12900HK, inside MSI’s GE76 Raider gaming laptop. And it turns out that Intel was right... with some caveats. </p><p id=\"oJlEmM\">The GE76 Raider is a monster in both gaming and productivity workloads. It blew every 11th Gen gaming system I’ve ever tested out of the water. And it even beat Apple’s MacBooks in many of our benchmarks, but that comparison is a bit more... complicated. </p><p id=\"hq8k0J\">Check out the video above to see the full results of our Alder Lake testing and our impressions of how it compares to the M1 Max. For even more benchmark results, in-depth performance analysis, and details about the laptop’s chassis, make sure you also read our <a href=\"https://www.theverge.com/22900362/msi-ge76-raider-review-alder-lake-17-inch-gaming-laptop\">full review of the GE76 Raider</a>. </p><p id=\"tEcBjs\"></p>",
