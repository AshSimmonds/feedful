  "description": "Like many other computer science concentrators at Brown, I began searching for a summer internship early last fall. In the weeks leading up to winter break, I saw many of my peers notify their LinkedIn connections that they would be spending their summers working for top tech companies. To my surprise, the majority of them demonstrated a dramatic bias towards Silicon Valley. The appeal of these offers is quite plain — the pay can be dramatically higher than alternatives in computer science research and academia. But I was still shocked to notice that even Brown students — as socially concerned as they generally are — were not driven to more impactful and experimental career paths. Frankly, industry salaries tell us little about how far we can actually advance technology itself, a consideration that ought to weigh far more on students who’ve had the world-class education that Brown offers.",
