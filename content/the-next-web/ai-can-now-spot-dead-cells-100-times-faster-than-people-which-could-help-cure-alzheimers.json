For neurodegenerative diseases such as Lou Gehrig’s disease, Alzheimer’s, and Parkinson’s, identifying dead and dying neurons is critical to developing and testing new treatments. But identifying dead cells can be tricky and has been a constant problem throughout my career as a neuroscientist. Until now, scientists have had to manually mark which cells look alive and which look dead under the microscope. Dead cells have a characteristic balled-up appearance that is relatively easy to recognize once you know what to look for.&#8230;<br /><br /><a href=\"https://thenextweb.com/news/ai-can-now-spot-dead-cells-100-times-faster-than-people-which-could-help-cure-alzheimers?utm_source=social&#038;utm_medium=feed&#038;utm_campaign=profeed\">This story continues</a> at The Next Web",
